                <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Hazel Diane Fernandez" width="200">
                <p>Hello! My name is Hazel Diane Fernandez, and I am from the Philippines. 
                    My acquaintances refer to me as Yani, and I hold a professional license as a Civil Engineer. 
                    I was a planning and design engineer with the Department of Public Works and Highways. 
                    But I recently transferred to Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority Engineering Department as a 
                    Project Development Division Civil Engineer. 
                    I'm a single mom to two amazing kids, Ashton and Hailey. Furthermore, I am passionate about music. 
                    I am a pianist, guitarist, and violinist. I am also able to perform dance and sing. 
                    Halo, League of Legends, and MLBB are some of the games that I play. 
                    I have a wonderful fiancé named Caleb. 
                    At present, I am a senior service missionary assigned to BYU Pathway Worldwide. 
                    I am also a counselor to the primary presidency and serve as a stake seminary teacher. 
                    I am also a pianist at the church and serve as the music chairman. 
                    I love chocolates and toasted squash seeds and pistacho. I believe that life is an intricate journey, 
                    and sometimes our emotions play a pivotal role in shaping our beliefs. That's why when I recently watched 
                    Inside Out 2, the movie instantly moved me. This movie is a sequel to Inside Out (2015) about a teenager 
                    Riley and how her emotions helped her to be her. One quote that I particularly like in the movie is that 
                    I somewhat relate to is, “Maybe this is what happens when you grow up. You feel less joy.” 
                    This simple yet profound statement captures the emotional weight of adulthood, 
                    where life's challenges can sometimes overshadow the joy we once felt as children. 
                    It's a reminder that despite the struggles, we still have the capacity to find happiness and meaning in our lives.
